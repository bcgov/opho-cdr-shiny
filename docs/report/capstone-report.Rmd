# Executive Summary 

The BC Chronic Disease Registry (BCCDR) is a data product that captures
information about the rates of new and persistent cases of 25 different chronic
diseases across the Province of British Columbia. Crude and age-standardized
rates of disease are recorded for different health boundary types, including HAs 
(Health Authorities) and CHSAs (Community Health Service Areas), as well as for demographic
variables such as sex. In this project we aim to develop and analysis pipeline to describe
the temporal trends in the data, and the build an interactive dashboard that will allow users
of all technical expertise to explore and visualize spatial and temporal information of the 
disease rates. This proposal will outline the approach we took to
tackle this problem and a description of our final data product.

# Introduction 

Millions of people in BC live with a chronic disease, so it's important
to understand and interpret the distribution of diseases
throughout the province for a variety of reasons. We may want to know
how to best allocate healthcare resources, or to identify if a specific
region is experiencing rapid growth of a disease. The dashboard is a
tool that will allow healthcare professionals and eventually the general
public to access the disease information and answer these questions.

The BC CDR captures 3 different types of rates that we will be incorporating into
our dashboard. Incidence Rate is the rate at which new cases occur in
a specified population during a specified time period; Lifetime
Prevalence is the proportion of individuals who have had the condition
for at least part of their lives, and Active Healthcare Contact
Prevalence are the cases for which a patient seeks healthcare services
for relapsing - remitting conditions. Each of these 3 rates are available
as Crude or Age Standardized rates. Age Standardized rates are adjusted
to the standard population, and are calculated as if all regions shared the same age structure,
that of the 2011 Canadian Census. Crude rates are not adjusted to the standard population, 
and represent the number of cases in a specific geographic region divided by the population
at risk in that region. For each disease rate metric, the data is stratified by year, 
sex and by region at various tiers. In this project we
focus on the least and the most granular spatial health boundaries, which are
the 5 Health Authorities (HA) and the 195 Community Health
Service Areas (CHSA).

## Temporal Modeling


## Dashboard

The dashboard facilitates the exploration and visualization of spatial and temporal trends of 
25 different chronic diseases across the Province of British Columbia. The dashboard consists of 4 main tabs,
which are Information, By Disease, By Region, and Data. The Information tab contains a description of the dashboard
usage, and definitions of rate types, diseases, and data variables. The By Disease tab allows for 
the comparisons of one disease over several HAs or CHSAs, while the By Region tab allows for the 
comparisons of several diseases in one particular HA or CHSA. The Data tab retrieves and displays all data specified
by the user, and contains a button to download the data if the user wishes to do so.




# Data Science Techniques

## Temporal Modeling

For temporal modeling, we selected the INLA approximation approach for Bayesian modeling. 
INLA is faster compared to Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation based methods (@wang_2018), 
and since there were over 10,000 combinations of 
CHSAs, diseases, and rates to be modeled, computational speed was a key consideration.
Potential disadvantages of INLA include that small variations between repeated runs 
can occur as a trade-off for the faster computation gained by using multiple cores (@wang_2018). 
However, these small variations are well beyond the significant digits of our data, therefore, we considered this to be an acceptable trade-off.

With INLA, we used a Gamma generalized linear model to smoothen the 
age-standardized rate, which is a continuous, positive response. The effect of
year was modeled using a Random Walk prior to account for temporal autocorrelation.
On each CHSA, disease, and rate, a first order random walk (RW1) 
and second order random walk (RW2) model was fit and the best RW model was selected using the
Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC).

A limitation of this approach was that rare diseases with low incidence and prevalence rates
could not be modeled, because the Gamma distribution does not provide support for values of 0.
Despite this limitation, our model was applied to 84% of incidence rate data, 91% of HSC prevalence rate data, and 98% of life prevalence rate data.

Alternative approaches that were explored to accommodate the zero values were to
use the Tweedie distribution, which can accommodate positive continuous data
with a point mass at zero (@kurz_2017). 
The implementation of the Tweedie distribution in R-INLA remains experimental and subject to change, 
however, and this approach was not further pursued due to poor model fit on our data. 
Zero-inflated gamma and hurdle gamma models were also investigated to accommodate zero values,
but were not supported by R-INLA at the time of this project.
